# **Exploratory Data Analysis - Glass Classification Dataset**
Day 8 of 100 Days of Exploratory Data Analysis

## **Content**
Machine Learning with R by Brett Lantz is a book that provides an introduction to machine learning using R. As far as I can tell, Packt Publishing does not make its datasets available online unless you buy the book and create a user account which can be a problem if you are checking the book out from the library or borrowing the book from a friend. All of these datasets are in the public domain but simply needed some cleaning up and recoding to match the format in the book.
